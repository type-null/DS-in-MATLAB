# Data Processing and Feature Engineering

Before you start, download [the code files and readings](https://www.mathworks.com/supportfiles/practicaldsmatlab/flights/Data%20Processing%20and%20Feature%20Engineering.zip) and [data files](https://www.mathworks.com/supportfiles/practicaldsmatlab/flights/Flights.zip).

Open MATLAB, navigate the Current Folder. Right click on the folder and select `Add to Path` -> `Selected Folders and Subfolders`.

__Important!__ In the MATLAB Command Window type ```savepath``` This will ensure the data files are always accessible every time you start MATLAB.
